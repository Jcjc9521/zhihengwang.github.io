Welcome！

Our group aims to integrate cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques with the modeling, design, and decision-making processes of large-scale structural and infrastructure systems.

We are particularly interested in:

- **Uncertainty Quantification in science and engineering**
- **Scientific Machine Learning**
- **Risk and Reliability Analysis**
- **Sensitivity Analysis**
- **Bayesian Inference**

We seek to develop intelligent, data-driven, and computationally efficient solutions for complex civil engineering challenges involving high uncertainty and limited information.
